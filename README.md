# PINS22-Compiler
Compiler for a simple (specifically created) programming language.

PINS22 is a simple programming language.
The Compiler takes for an argument a source file, which has the source code written in the PINS language (file can be any name, any extension).

PINS22 doesn't have a lot of usability, but it is a fun challenge to create algorithms and such. Kind of like building a complex machine with only 3 types of lego bricks.
The programming language has:
- Primitive types INT and CHAR, but also NONE (void) and NIL (pointer to none). That's it.
- If and While statements.
- It uses pointers.
- It's strongly typed, meaning *num = 'c'* doesn't work (if num is INT).

Some examples are added in the file Sandbox.p22
